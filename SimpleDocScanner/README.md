# DocSnap – SimpleDocScanner

**DocSnap** is a fast, private, and easy-to-use document scanner for iPhone.

## 📱 Features

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Open the app**  
   Tap the app icon — you’ll see the main screen with options to scan or go to settings.

2. **Tap “Scan Document”**  
   Use your camera to scan one or more pages. The app will automatically crop and enhance the scans.

3. **Review your pages**  
   After scanning, you can:
   - Reorder or delete pages
   - Tap **Scan More** to add more pages
   - Tap **Save PDF** or **Share PDF**

4. **Customize the filename (optional)**  
   Before saving or sharing, you’ll be prompted to confirm or rename the file.

5. **Save or Share**
   - If a folder is set in **Settings**, “Save PDF” will save directly to that location.
   - “Share PDF” will open the share sheet regardless of settings.
   - If no default folder is set, both options use the share sheet.

6. **Success!**  
   You’ll see a confirmation when your PDF is saved successfully.

## ⚙️ Settings
- Choose a default folder (e.g., KeepIt, Downloads, iCloud Drive) for saving PDFs.
- Reset the folder to use the share sheet instead.
- Force light/dark mode or follow the system appearance.
- View app version and credits.
